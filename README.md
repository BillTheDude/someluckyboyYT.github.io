## What I learned
This was my first time Web Development project I ever worked on. This project really increased my interest on getting into the Web Dev field, mainly on the front-end side. Also, from my mistakes I did during development, this allowed me to research articles on how to improve and learn new skills. This led me to discover the importance of learning web frameworks in order to avoid the same mistakes and how to use their tools in a more clever way.
